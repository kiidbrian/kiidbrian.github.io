## Bio

I'm a pragmatic software engineer and data scientist passionate about building reliable, scalable systems that solve real-world problems.

With deep experience across E-commerce, FinTech, Payments, Hospitality, and Education, I've led the technical foundation of multiple US startups and modernized data modeling for a major Ghanaian bank using cloud-native services. My skill set spans full-stack web & mobile development, middleware architecture, robust data pipelines, and now — after completing my M.Sc. in Data Science at the University of Stirling — machine learning, big data processing, and advanced analytics.

Highlights include:
* Architecting high-throughput payment & booking platforms serving thousands of daily users
* Migrating legacy banking data models to cloud environments for improved performance & cost efficiency
* Leading cross-functional teams to deliver production-grade solutions under tight deadlines

I'm always excited to collaborate on challenging projects, mentor emerging talent, or help organizations turn data into actionable impact.Let's build something meaningful — reach out if you're working on innovative tech in Africa, fintech, edtech, or scalable infrastructure!
